## Code of Conduct & Commitment to Maintain Package

- [ ] I agree to abide by [pyOpenSci's Code of Conduct][PyOpenSciCodeOfConduct] during the review process and in maintaining my package after should it be accepted.
- [ ] I have read and will commit to package maintenance after the review as per the [pyOpenSci Policies Guidelines][Commitment].

## Description

- Include a brief paragraph describing what your package does:


## Scope

- Please indicate which category or categories. 
Check out our [package scope page][PackageCategories] to learn more about our 
scope. (If you are unsure of which category you fit, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry):

	- [ ] Data retrieval
	- [ ] Data extraction
	- [ ] Data processing/munging
	- [ ] Data deposition
	- [ ] Data validation and testing
	- [ ] Data visualization[^1]
	- [ ] Workflow automation
	- [ ] Citation management and bibliometrics
	- [ ] Scientific software wrappers
	- [ ] Database interoperability

Domain Specific & Community Partnerships 

	- [ ] Geospatial
	- [ ] Education
	- [ ] Pangeo
	

## Community Partnerships
If your package is associated with an 
existing community please check below:

- [ ] [Pangeo][pangeoWebsite]
	- [ ] My package adheres to the [Pangeo standards listed in the pyOpenSci peer review guidebook][PangeoCollaboration]

> [^1]: Please fill out a pre-submission inquiry before submitting a data visualization package.

- **For all submissions**, explain how the and why the package falls under the categories you indicated above. In your explanation, please address the following points (briefly, 1-2 sentences for each):  

  - Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?  

  - Are there other Python packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does yours differ?

  - If you made a pre-submission enquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or `@tag` the editor you contacted:

## Technical checks

For details about the pyOpenSci packaging requirements, see our [packaging guide][PackagingGuide]. Confirm each of the following by checking the box. This package:

- [ ] does not violate the Terms of Service of any service it interacts with. 
- [ ] uses an [OSI approved license][OsiApprovedLicense].
- [ ] contains a README with instructions for installing the development version. 
- [ ] includes documentation with examples for all functions.
- [ ] contains a tutorial with examples of its essential functions and uses.
- [ ] has a test suite.
- [ ] has continuous integration setup, such as GitHub Actions CircleCI, and/or others.

## Publication Options

- [ ] Do you wish to automatically submit to the [Journal of Open Source Software][JournalOfOpenSourceSoftware]? If so:

<details>
 <summary>JOSS Checks</summary>  

- [ ] The package has an **obvious research application** according to JOSS's definition in their [submission requirements][JossSubmissionRequirements]. Be aware that completing the pyOpenSci review process **does not** guarantee acceptance to JOSS. Be sure to read their submission requirements (linked above) if you are interested in submitting to JOSS.
- [ ] The package is not a "minor utility" as defined by JOSS's [submission requirements][JossSubmissionRequirements]: "Minor ‘utility’ packages, including ‘thin’ API clients, are not acceptable." pyOpenSci welcomes these packages under "Data Retrieval", but JOSS has slightly different criteria.
- [ ] The package contains a `paper.md` matching [JOSS's requirements][JossPaperRequirements] with a high-level description in the package root or in `inst/`.
- [ ] The package is deposited in a long-term repository with the DOI: 

*Note: Do not submit your package separately to JOSS*
  
</details>

## Are you OK with Reviewers Submitting Issues and/or pull requests to your Repo Directly?
This option will allow reviewers to open smaller issues that can then be linked to PR's rather than submitting a more dense text based review. It will also allow you to demonstrate addressing the issue via PR links.

- [x] Yes I am OK with reviewers submitting requested changes as issues to my repo. Reviewers will then link to the issues in their submitted review.

Confirm each of the following by checking the box.

- [ ] I have read the [author guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/author-guide.html). 
- [ ] I expect to maintain this package for at least 2 years and can help find a replacement for the maintainer (team) if needed.

## Please fill out our survey

- [ ] [Last but not least please fill out our pre-review survey](https://forms.gle/F9mou7S3jhe8DMJ16). This helps us track
submission and improve our peer review process. We will also ask our reviewers 
and editors to fill this out.
