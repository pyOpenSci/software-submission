# pyOpenSci Software Peer Review

## READ ME FIRST
pyOpenSci is currently on pause while we move to a new home. We will be back in action in September 2022. We suggest that you hold off on submitting a package for review until the fall 2022. Questions? Please feel free to post in the [discussions section of this repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/discussions).

This repo hosts the pyOpenSci review process. Packages contributed to pyOpenSci undergo an open peer-review by community reviewers.

If you are interested in submitting a package, check out our [guidebook][Guidebook] for info about how to package your code and submit a request for review. For authors, the most important sections are the [scope of pyOpenSci][Scope], the [author guide][AuthorGuide], and the [
packaging guide][PackagingGuide]. For details about the exact timeline and process of peer-review, see [peer review timeline][PeerReviewTimeline].

When you are ready to submit for review, fill out the [Submission template][SubmissionTemplate]
.

If your package is not yet fully-developed or you're not sure whether it fits within pyOpenSci's [
scope][Scope], you can create a [presubmission inquiry issue][PresubmissionInquiryIssue].
